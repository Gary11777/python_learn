In this section, we will use Python's built-in open function to create a file object and obtain the data from a txt file. We will use Python's open function to get a file object. We can apply a method to that object to read data from the file. We can open the file example1.txt as follows. We use the open function. The first argument is the file path. This is made up of the file name and the file directory. 
The second parameter is the mode. Common values used include r for reading, w for writing, and a for appending. We will use r for reading. Finally, we have the file object. We can now use the file object to obtain information about the file. We can use the data attribute name to get the name of the file. The result is a string that contains the name of the file.
